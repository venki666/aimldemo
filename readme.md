# Embedded AI and Machine Learning
## Description: 
Embedded AI and Machine Learning refers to the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques into embedded systems. Embedded AI to explore Understanding and generating models on small and resource-constrained devices, such as microcontrollers and sensors, which typically have limited memory, processing power, and energy resources. This course enables students the broad knowledge to develop intelligent, efficient, and cost effective IOT devices. It also provides the students with opportunities for innovation, and fosters interdisciplinary skills and knowledge.
